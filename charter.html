        <!-- Preamble -->
        <section class="py-10 border-b border-gray-700" id="preamble">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Preamble</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This document, The Jasmine Field Orchestra Charter, constitutes the foundational and primary governing agreement for the organization. It serves as the binding agreement between the Jasmine Field Orchestra at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (hereafter "JFO") and its members. It outlines the organization's purpose, structure, principles of membership, financial framework, and the shared standards of conduct that enable a collaborative, respectful, and artistically vibrant environment for all. Adherence to this Charter is a condition of membership and is essential for the operational stability, financial health, and collective success of the organization.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Article I -->
        <section class="py-10 border-b border-gray-700" id="article-i">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Article I: Foundational Principles</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">This section establishes the core identity and guiding philosophy of JFO. It links the organization's artistic ambitions to the non-negotiable standards of the university community, framing compliance not as a bureaucratic hurdle, but as a strategic imperative for fostering a healthy and creative environment.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">1.1 Mission Statement</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The mission of JFO is to provide a vibrant, cross-cultural platform for University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students and affiliated community members to create, perform, and share music. The organization is dedicated to fostering collaboration, community, and artistic growth across a diverse spectrum of musical genres, including but not limited to pop/rock, jazz, orchestral, choral, and folk traditions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">1.2 Vision Statement</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">JFO aspires to be the premier home for musicians at UIUC, recognized for its artistic excellence, its inclusive and supportive community, and its sustainable, transparent, and member-driven operational structure.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">1.3 Core Values</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">The following values guide the decisions and actions of the organization and its members:</p>
            <ul class="charter-list list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong class="text-white">Collaboration:</strong> We believe our greatest strength comes from the fusion of different musical traditions and the shared efforts of our members across all divisions.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Passion:</strong> We are driven by a shared love for music that fuels our creativity, dedication, and pursuit of excellence.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Inclusivity:</strong> We are fundamentally committed to creating a welcoming and equitable environment for all members, ensuring that every individual feels valued and has the opportunity to contribute.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">Accountability:</strong> We operate with transparency and take collective ownership of our responsibilities to the organization, the university community, and each other.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-pink-400">1.4 Statement of Nondiscrimination</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">JFO explicitly adopts and adheres to the University of Illinois's nondiscrimination policy as a cornerstone of its identity. As a condition of its status as a Registered Student Organization (RSO), membership and participation in JFO must be open to all currently enrolled University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students, without regard to actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, or any other status protected by applicable law or university policy.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">This commitment is not merely a compliance requirement; it is a prerequisite for achieving our artistic mission. The internal friction and factionalism that have hindered the organization in the past are antithetical to the principles of open collaboration. A community cannot be truly collaborative or artistically vibrant if it is not also fundamentally inclusive and fair. By embedding the university's non-discrimination policy into our foundational principles, JFO affirms that a respectful and equitable environment is the bedrock upon which great music is made.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">JFO maintains two separate physical financial accounts to manage its funds:</p>
            <ul class="charter-list list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300 mb-6">
                <li><strong class="text-white">The Student Organization Finance Center (SOFC) Account:</strong> This university-administered account is used exclusively for transactions involving the university. This includes receiving funding from university sources (like SORF) and paying for on-campus services such as venue rentals. This account is not used for general operations or as the JFO General Fund.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">The JFO External Bank Account:</strong> This is the primary financial account for the organization, held at an external financial institution. All membership dues, performance revenue, sponsorships, and other non-university income are deposited here. All general operational expenses are paid from this account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">5.2 Principle of Divisional Financial Autonomy</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Each primary musical division within JFO will operate with financial independence. All revenue generated from a division's specific activities will be directly deposited into The JFO External Bank Account. This revenue will then be logged in that division's individual logical account after calculation. The leadership of each division holds the authority to approve expenditures from their respective logical account.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">5.3 Divisional Accounts</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">The JFO Treasurer will maintain logically separate accounts within the JFO External Bank Account for its two primary musical arms:</p>
            <ul class="charter-list list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300 mb-6">
                <li><strong class="text-white">The Cadence Account:</strong> For the Live Bands division.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">5.4 The JFO General Fund</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">To support shared infrastructure and services, JFO will maintain a General Fund within the external bank account. This fund is a dedicated budget for essential, organization-wide costs and is composed of two parts:</p>
            <ul class="charter-list list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300 mb-6">
                <li><strong class="text-white">The Operating Budget:</strong> Covers predictable, recurring costs such as shared storage, website hosting, general marketing, and maintenance of JFO Central Property.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-white">The Contingency &amp; Growth Fund:</strong> The organization's savings account, designed to cover unexpected financial emergencies and provide strategic co-sponsorship for major, cross-divisional events.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-pink-400">5.5 General Fund Contribution Mechanism</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">To ensure fairness and sustainability, contributions to the JFO General Fund are made from each instance of revenue generation. This "platform fee" model uses different calculations for membership dues versus other revenue to ensure the contribution is equitable and logical for the type of income received.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">The contribution from semesterly membership dues is calculated using a hybrid formula that combines a per-member fee with a percentage of total dues collected.</p>
