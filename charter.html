            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Preamble</h2>
            <p>This document, The Jasmine Field Orchestra Charter, constitutes the foundational and primary governing agreement for the organization. It serves as the binding agreement between the Jasmine Field Orchestra at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (hereafter "JFO") and its members. It outlines the organization's purpose, structure, principles of membership, financial framework, and the shared standards of conduct that enable a collaborative, respectful, and artistically vibrant environment for all. Adherence to this Charter is a condition of membership and is essential for the operational stability, financial health, and collective success of the organization.</p>

    <section class="py-10">
        <div class="container mx-auto px-6 space-y-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Article I: Foundational Principles</h2>
            <p>This section establishes the core identity and guiding philosophy of JFO. It links the organization's artistic ambitions to the non-negotiable standards of the university community, framing compliance not as a bureaucratic hurdle, but as a strategic imperative for fostering a healthy and creative environment.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">1.1 Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>The mission of JFO is to provide a vibrant, cross-cultural platform for University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students and affiliated community members to create, perform, and share music. The organization is dedicated to fostering collaboration, community, and artistic growth across a diverse spectrum of musical genres, including but not limited to pop/rock, jazz, orchestral, choral, and folk traditions.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">1.2 Vision Statement</h3>
            <p>JFO aspires to be the premier home for musicians at UIUC, recognized for its artistic excellence, its inclusive and supportive community, and its sustainable, transparent, and member-driven operational structure.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">1.3 Core Values</h3>
            <p>The following values guide the decisions and actions of the organization and its members:</p>
            <p>Collaboration: We believe our greatest strength comes from the fusion of different musical traditions and the shared efforts of our members across all divisions.<br>
Passion: We are driven by a shared love for music that fuels our creativity, dedication, and pursuit of excellence.<br>
Inclusivity: We are fundamentally committed to creating a welcoming and equitable environment for all members, ensuring that every individual feels valued and has the opportunity to contribute.<br>
Accountability: We operate with transparency and take collective ownership of our responsibilities to the organization, the university community, and each other.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">1.4 Statement of Nondiscrimination</h3>
            <p>JFO explicitly adopts and adheres to the University of Illinois's nondiscrimination policy as a cornerstone of its identity. As a condition of its status as a Registered Student Organization (RSO), membership and participation in JFO must be open to all currently enrolled University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign students, without regard to actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, or any other status protected by applicable law or university policy.</p>
            <p>This commitment is not merely a compliance requirement; it is a prerequisite for achieving our artistic mission. The internal friction and factionalism that have hindered the organization in the past are antithetical to the principles of open collaboration. A community cannot be truly collaborative or artistically vibrant if it is not also fundamentally inclusive and fair. By embedding the university's non-discrimination policy into our foundational principles, JFO affirms that a respectful and equitable environment is the bedrock upon which great music is made.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Article V: The "JFO as a Platform" Financial Framework</h2>
            <p>This section codifies the organization's financial model, which is designed to provide divisional autonomy while ensuring collective stability and compliance with UIUC financial policies.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.1 Financial Accounts</h3>
            <p>JFO maintains two separate physical financial accounts to manage its funds:<br>
The Student Organization Finance Center (SOFC) Account: This university-administered account is used exclusively for transactions involving the university. This includes receiving funding from university sources (like SORF) and paying for on-campus services such as venue rentals. This account is not used for general operations or as the JFO General Fund.<br>
The JFO External Bank Account: This is the primary financial account for the organization, held at an external financial institution. All membership dues, performance revenue, sponsorships, and other non-university income are deposited here. All general operational expenses are paid from this account.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.2 Principle of Divisional Financial Autonomy</h3>
            <p>Each primary musical division within JFO will operate with financial independence. All revenue generated from a division's specific activities will be directly deposited into The JFO External Bank Account. This revenue will then be logged in that division's individual logical account after calculation. The leadership of each division holds the authority to approve expenditures from their respective logical account.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.3 Divisional Accounts</h3>
            <p>The JFO Treasurer will maintain logically separate accounts within the JFO External Bank Account for its two primary musical arms:<br>
The Cadence Account: For the Live Bands division.<br>
The Harmony Account: For the Orchestra divisions, including the Symphony Orchestra, Chinese Folk Music ensemble, and Choir.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.4 The JFO General Fund</h3>
            <p>To support shared infrastructure and services, JFO will maintain a General Fund within the external bank account. This fund is a dedicated budget for essential, organization-wide costs and is composed of two parts:<br>
The Operating Budget: Covers predictable, recurring costs such as shared storage, website hosting, general marketing, and maintenance of JFO Central Property.<br>
The Contingency & Growth Fund: The organization's savings account, designed to cover unexpected financial emergencies and provide strategic co-sponsorship for major, cross-divisional events.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.5 General Fund Contribution Mechanism</h3>
            <p>To ensure fairness and sustainability, contributions to the JFO General Fund are made from each instance of revenue generation. This "platform fee" model uses different calculations for membership dues versus other revenue to ensure the contribution is equitable and logical for the type of income received.</p>
            <p>A. Contribution from Membership Dues<br>
The contribution from semesterly membership dues is calculated using a hybrid formula that combines a per-member fee with a percentage of total dues collected.<br>
Dues Contribution Formula: Dues Contribution = (Number of Members × Per-Member Fee) + (Total Dues Collected × Platform Percentage)<br>
Formula Components & Default Base Rates:<br>
Per-Member Fee: A fixed dollar amount for each dues-paying member. The default base rate is $5.00 per member.<br>
Platform Percentage: A fixed percentage of the total dues collected by the division. The default base rate is 15%.</p>
            <p>Example Calculation (Membership Dues):<br>
Situation: The Cadence division has 30 members paying $50 each.<br>
Calculation:<br>
Total Dues Collected: 30 members × $50 = $1,500<br>
Per-Member Portion: 30 members × $5.00 = $150<br>
Platform Percentage Portion: $1,500 × 0.15 = $225<br>
Total Cadence Contribution: $150 + $225 = $375</p>
            <p>B. Contribution from Performance & Event Revenue<br>
The contribution from other revenue sources, such as commercial shows or ticketed concerts, is calculated based on the gross revenue of the event plus a levy for the use of high-value shared assets.<br>
Event Contribution Formula: Event Contribution = (Gross Event Revenue × Performance Percentage) + High-Impact Asset Levy (HIAL)<br>
Formula Components & Default Base Rates:<br>
Performance Percentage: A fixed percentage of the gross revenue from the event. The default base rate is 15%.<br>
High-Impact Asset Levy (HIAL): A tiered, fixed fee applied only when the event requires the use of designated JFO Central Property. The default HIAL tiers are:<br>
Tier 1: $25.00 (Use of the shared drum kit OR the portable mixing board)<br>
Tier 2: $50.00 (Use of the full JFO PA system)<br>
Tier 3: $75.00 (Use of both the full PA system and the drum kit)</p>
            <p>Example Calculation (Commercial Performance):<br>
Situation: The Cadence division is paid $400 for a performance and uses the JFO Central PA system (Tier 2 HIAL).<br>
Calculation:<br>
Performance Percentage Portion: $400 × 0.15 = $60<br>
HIAL Portion: $50<br>
Total Event Contribution: $60 + $50 = $110</p>
            <p>C. Flexibility of Rates<br>
The default base rates specified in this Charter shall be used for all calculations. These rates may be adjusted for a specific academic year only if a formal proposal is made and approved by the Executive Board.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.6 Management of Sponsorships and Donations</h3>
            <p>To ensure fairness and maximize organizational benefit, all monetary sponsorships and donations ("cash" contributions) are managed centrally.<br>
Principle of Centralization: All cash sponsorships are considered contributions to the JFO organization as a whole, not to a specific division, unless explicitly and contractually designated for a specific purpose by the sponsor.<br>
Deposit of Funds: All cash sponsorships must be deposited directly into the JFO General Fund within the external bank account.<br>
Use and Distribution: These funds will be managed by the Executive Board and allocated primarily through the Contingency & Growth Fund. The primary purpose of these funds is to support large-scale, cross-divisional projects, strategic initiatives, or to cover significant unbudgeted expenses that benefit the entire organization. Divisions may apply for these funds for special projects via the standard JFO Internal Funding Request Form, with priority given to proposals that demonstrate broad benefit to the JFO community.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5.7 Budgeting, Reporting & Transparency</h3>
            <p>To build member trust, the following procedures are established:<br>
Regular Financial Reporting: The Treasurer will provide a summary financial report at every general membership meeting except the very first meeting in Fall term.<br>
Access to Information: Any member in good standing may request a detailed, itemized transaction report for their own division's account.</p>
